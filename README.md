# Foundry EVM Mini

A copy of https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry

Foundry introduces new changes to their repo everyday, and this can cause projects using foundry-evm break every once in a while.

This foundry-evm-mini project is an attempt to take a snapshot of the library so that it never breaks again.

Currently supports:

- SharedBackend (evm/executor/fork)
- BlockchainDB (evm/executor/fork)
- BlockchainDBMeta (evm/executor/fork)
